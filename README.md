✅Convolutional Neural Network - Explained in simple terms with implementation details (code, techniques and best tips)👇🏻🧵

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks primarily designed to process and analyze grid-like data, such as images and videos. CNNs are particularly well-suited for tasks involving pattern recognition and feature extraction from visual data.

Layers: A CNN consists of multiple layers that perform different tasks. The key layers are:

Convolutional Layer: This is where the filters slide over the image to detect patterns.

Pooling Layer: This layer reduces dimensions of the image, making network faster and more efficient. It  helps retain important features.
Fully Connected Layer: This layer connects the features learned by the previous layers to make final decisions about what's in the image.

Convolution and Feature Extraction:
Convolutional layers in CNNs are responsible for detecting local patterns and features in images. They use filters  to slide over the input image and perform a mathematical operation called convolution.

Filters in convolutional layers learn to recognize various features like edges, textures, and more complex patterns. During training, CNNs adjust the filter weights so that they become sensitive to specific patterns in the input images.

Transfer Learning:
Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning and deep learning where a model that has been trained on one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

In the context of CNNs, transfer learning involves using a pre-trained neural network model as a foundation for solving a related but different problem.

Pre-trained Models as Feature Extractors:
Pre-trained CNNs are models that have already been trained on massive datasets, often for image classification tasks. They have learned to extract valuable features from images.
